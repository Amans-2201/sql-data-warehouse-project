# Data Transformation, Cleansing, and Normalization Guidelines

## Overview

This document provides best practices and steps for transforming, cleansing, and normalizing data in the Silver Layer of your data warehouse. Following these guidelines ensures data quality, consistency, and readiness for analytics and reporting.

## 1. Data Transformation

Transformation is the process of converting raw data into a structured and usable format. It includes:

- **Data Enrichment:** Enhance data by adding relevant information from external or internal sources.
- **Data Integration:** Combine data from multiple sources to provide a unified view.
- **Derived Columns:** Create new columns by deriving values from existing data (e.g., calculations, formatting).
- **Data Normalization & Standardization:** Convert data into a standard format (e.g., date formats, units of measure).
- **Business Rules & Logic:** Apply business-specific transformations, such as categorization or mapping codes to descriptions.
- **Data Aggregations:** Summarize or group data (e.g., totals, averages).

## 2. Data Cleansing

Data cleansing ensures that data is accurate, complete, and reliable. Key activities include:

- **Remove Duplicates:** Identify and eliminate duplicate records.
- **Data Filtering:** Exclude irrelevant or unnecessary data based on criteria.
- **Handling Missing Data:** Address gaps in data by imputing values, removing records, or flagging them for review.
- **Handling Invalid Values:** Detect and correct data that does not conform to expected formats or ranges.
- **Handling Unwanted Spaces:** Trim leading, trailing, or excessive spaces from text fields.
- **Outlier Detection:** Identify and handle data points that deviate significantly from the norm.
- **Data Type Casting:** Ensure all data fields are stored in the correct data types (e.g., integers, dates).

## 3. Data Normalization & Standardization

Normalization and standardization ensure consistency across datasets:

- **Normalize Values:** Convert values to a common scale or format (e.g., all dates in `YYYY-MM-DD` format).
- **Standardize Codes and Labels:** Use consistent naming conventions and code mappings (e.g., gender as 'Male'/'Female', country codes as ISO standards).
- **Unit Standardization:** Ensure all measurements use the same units (e.g., converting all weights to kilograms).

## 4. Implementation Tips

- Use CTEs or staging tables for intermediate steps.
- Document all transformation and cleansing steps in code comments and project documentation.
- Validate data after each major transformation or cleansing step.
- Automate repetitive cleansing tasks where possible.
- Maintain data lineage for traceability.

## 5. Example Workflow

1. **Extract** raw data from source systems.
2. **Cleanse** data:
   - Remove duplicates
   - Handle missing/invalid values
   - Trim spaces
   - Cast data types
3. **Transform** data:
   - Apply business rules
   - Derive new columns
   - Aggregate as needed
4. **Normalize/Standardize**:
   - Format dates, codes, and units
5. **Load** cleansed and transformed data into the Silver Layer.

## 6. Review & Validation

- Regularly review transformation logic with business stakeholders.
- Use data profiling tools to monitor data quality.
- Set up automated tests to catch anomalies early.

By following these guidelines, you can ensure your Silver Layer data is clean, consistent, and ready for downstream analytics and reporting.
